Name,Explanation
Spring Boot,"A framework designed to simplify the creation of standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal configuration. It provides auto-configuration, embedded servers (like Tomcat), and opinionated defaults to accelerate development and deployment. Used for building microservices, REST APIs, and enterprise applications quickly."
Spring MVC,"A model-view-controller framework for building traditional server-side web applications using JSP, Thymeleaf, or other templating engines. It handles HTTP requests, form processing, validation, and dynamic HTML rendering. Used for developing websites with server-rendered UIs, such as admin panels and content management systems."
Spring WebFlux,"A reactive, non-blocking web framework built on Project Reactor (Flux/Mono) for building highly scalable, event-driven applications. It supports both annotation-based and functional programming models. Used for high-concurrency APIs, real-time systems, and applications requiring low-latency responses under heavy load."
Spring Cloud,"A collection of tools and libraries for building distributed systems and microservices architectures. Includes components like service discovery (Eureka), API gateways (Gateway), configuration management (Config Server), circuit breakers (Hystrix/Resilience4j), and distributed tracing. Used to manage complexity in cloud-native applications with multiple interconnected services."
Spring Security,"A powerful and highly customizable authentication and authorization framework. Supports form login, OAuth2, JWT, LDAP, SAML, CSRF protection, and method-level security. Used to secure web applications, REST APIs, and microservices by controlling access to resources and protecting against common attacks."
Spring REST (RESTful Services),Refers to Spring’s support for building RESTful web services using annotations like @RestController", "@RequestMapping", and "@ResponseBody". Services return data in JSON or XML format for consumption by clients such as mobile apps, SPAs, or other services. Used to create interoperable, stateless APIs that follow REST principles."
Spring Data,"A unified abstraction layer for data access across relational and non-relational databases. Provides repositories (e.g., JpaRepository, ReactiveMongoRepository) with automatic query generation and CRUD operations based on method names or annotations. Used to reduce boilerplate code when interacting with databases and improve developer productivity."
Spring Batch,"A framework for processing large volumes of data in batch jobs. Supports chunking, restartability, skip logic, transaction management, and job scheduling. Used for nightly data imports, report generation, ETL processes, financial reconciliations, and bulk data migrations."
Spring Integration,"An enterprise integration framework implementing patterns from the “Enterprise Integration Patterns” book. Enables message routing, transformation, channeling, and adaptation between different systems via adapters (FTP, SMTP, JMS, etc.). Used to connect heterogeneous systems and build message-driven architectures."
Spring Test,"A comprehensive testing framework for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing of Spring applications. Provides annotations like "@SpringBootTest", "@MockBean", and "MockMvc" to simulate the application context and HTTP requests. Used to ensure reliability, prevent regressions, and validate behavior across layers of an application."
Spring Cache,"An abstraction layer over caching providers like Redis, Ehcache, Caffeine, and ConcurrentHashMap. Uses annotations ("@Cacheable", "@CacheEvict", "@CachePut) to automatically cache method results and invalidate stale data. Used to improve performance by reducing redundant database calls or expensive computations.
Spring Kafka / Spring AMQP,"Modules for integrating Spring applications with Apache Kafka (publish-subscribe messaging) and RabbitMQ (AMQP protocol). Provide template classes and listener containers for producing and consuming messages asynchronously. Used to implement event-driven architectures, decouple microservices, and handle asynchronous workflows."
Spring GraphQL,"A framework for building GraphQL APIs in Spring applications. Allows defining schemas, resolvers, and data fetchers using annotations or functional style. Supports subscription, mutation, and query operations. Used to create flexible, client-driven APIs where consumers request only the data they need, improving network efficiency."
